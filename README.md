# 🍴 Forkify App

A modern recipe management web application that allows users to search for recipes, view cooking instructions, bookmark their favorites, and even upload their own recipes — all powered by asynchronous JavaScript and a clean MVC architecture.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Forkify** is a single-page web application (SPA) built using modern JavaScript (ES6+), following the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture.  
It interacts with the **Forkify API** to fetch real-time recipe data, display search results, handle pagination, manage bookmarks using local storage, and allow users to upload new recipes.

This project demonstrates advanced front-end development concepts such as:

- Asynchronous programming with `async/await`
- Application state management
- DOM updates and virtual rendering
- Data persistence using local storage
- Modular JavaScript and build automation with Parcel

## 🧠 Architecture

The app follows a **modular MVC architecture** for maintainability and scalability.

### Core Components:

- **Model:**  
  Handles data fetching, application state, and business logic (API calls, bookmarks, uploads).
- **View:**  
  Responsible for rendering UI components such as recipe view, search results, pagination, and bookmarks.
- **Controller:**  
  Connects Model and View — handles events, updates state, and triggers re-rendering.

### Data Flow Summary:

1. User searches for a recipe → async API call fetches data → results rendered.
2. User selects a recipe → recipe data loaded and displayed.
3. Bookmarks are stored in and loaded from local storage.
4. Users can upload their own recipes → sent to API → rendered in app.
